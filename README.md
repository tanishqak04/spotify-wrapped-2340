What is the purpose of our app? 
We created a platform for music enthusiasts to better understand their music taste in a fun format. It's an enhanced version of Spotify Wrapped in that it allows to user to access music summaries at more frequent intervals. 

How does it work? 
The user is able to sign into our app with their actual Spotify profile and link their accounts. Their account's data is stored and utilized to generate a detailed and creative display of the user's music listening habits. The user's data is also saved which allows them to access their previous Spotify Wrapped summaries in order to analyze the evolution in their music taste overtime. They're able to update their log in info or delete their account as they wish. 

We implemented the following user stories and features:

Their data will be stored so that their account information is saved after exiting the app.  They are also able to update their account information and delete their account as they wish.
