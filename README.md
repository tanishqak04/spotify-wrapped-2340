What is the purpose of our app? 
We created a platform for music enthusiasts to better understand their music taste in a fun format. It's an enhanced version of Spotify Wrapped in that it allows to user to access music summaries at more frequent intervals. 

How does it work? 
The user is able to sign into our app with their actual Spotify profile and link their accounts. Their account's data is stored and utilized to generate a detailed and creative display of the user's music listening habits. The user's data is also saved which allows them to access their previous Spotify Wrapped summaries in order to analyze the evolution in their music taste overtime. They're able to update their log in info or delete their account as they wish. 

We implemented the following user stories and features:

- User Story 1 - Wrapped Summary: This allows the user to view a presenation of the different variations of their personal Spotify music listening tastes in a colorful and fun manner. It also lets the user log into their personal account from the app.
- User Story 2 - Login/Past Wraps: The user can create and account and log into the app itself to view their past wrapped summaries. Their data will be stored so that their account information is saved after exiting the app.  They are also able to update their account information and delete their account as they wish. 
- User Story 4 - Holiday Versions: Special holiday versions of the user's wrapped summaries are  generated and accessible to view on specific days of the year. Our app has versions for Halloween, Christmas, and Easter.
- User Story 7 - New Artists: Based on the user's music tastes, the app also recommends new artists!
- User Story 8 - Timespan Options: The user is able to control the timespan of the generated wrapped summaries. The time intervals include 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year. 
- User Story 10 - CI/CD Pipeline: Developer's can utilize a CI/CD pipeline to test code and verify that it builds and is formatted correctly.
- User Story 11 - Export Summary: Users can export a summary of their Wrapped as an image file. This allows them to easily copy and share with others outside of the app. 
- User Story 12 - Firebase: Firebase implementation lets the user sign into their account from any device. 
- User Story 14 - Settings: The settings page allows the user to access different types of functionality in one screen - notifications, dark mode, update and delete account.
